# max size error when deploying ruleapp or xom

Depending on the size of your XOM or the size of your Ruleapp, you may have the following error generated
by Fabric: 

"Error: error trying invoke chaincode. Error: Error: Received message larger than max (5868842 vs. 4194304)"

To workaround this error you need to perform the following actions:
- stop Fabric
- change the ~/.composer-connection-profiles/hlfv1/connection.json 
profile file store in your home directory to add the following 'maxRecvSize' and 'maxSendSize' properties:

{
    "type": "hlfv1",
    "orderers": [
       { "url" : "grpc://localhost:7050" }
    ],
    "ca": { "url": "http://localhost:7054", 
            "name": "ca.org1.example.com"
    },
    "peers": [
        {
            "requestURL": "grpc://localhost:7051",
            "eventURL": "grpc://localhost:7053"
        }
    ],
    "keyValStore": "/Users/johnsmith/.composer-credentials",
    "channel": "composerchannel",
    "mspID": "Org1MSP",
    "timeout": "300"
    "maxSendSize": "20971520",
    "maxRecvSize": "20971520",
}

This will allow messages of 20M instead of the default 4M. 

- restart Fabric after this change.
