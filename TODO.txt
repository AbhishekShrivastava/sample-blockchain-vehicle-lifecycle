# TASKS
- add license & legal statement in Readme. 
- document OS prerequisites and point to ODM installation guide in README
- add license support for hamcrest, jackson and junit used in the XOM
- move the decision service to Decision Engine
- add java unit test to the decision logic so that we can test the logic without the blockchain
- we should have a script command (maven-based?) that allows to generate the ruleapp based on ODM 8.9 build commad.
  The script takes the decision service source and generate a ruleapp jar and the XOM that could be deployed using cli api through
  the blockchain.
- script to deploy Ruleapp and XOM to the RES running in Docker
        [alternative is to use the deployment through Blockchain]
- enable odm-deployer-webapp instead of odm-deployer
- review XOM deployment, does not work if the transaction is rolled-back as side effect on RES is not rolledback

# V2 
- reuse the exact same CTO as the Composer demo (see inheritance of Person)
- change IsSuspiciousTransferDecisionService to a concept when Composer supports serialization of a Concept as a root
- show how to create an HA topology
    - set-up an instance of RES per instance of peers
        - support HA: if a peer/RES goes down, the second one take over
        - need to map ports so that Smart Contract uses only one URL
