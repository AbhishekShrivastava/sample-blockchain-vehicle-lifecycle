# odm-deployer
This REST service implements a facade to the management API of the RES. It allows to deploy 
XOM and Ruleapps to the RES from dedicated Smart Contracts involved on specific deployment transactions. 

# setting up the deployer 

- Launch a terminal window and go the odm-deployer project directory
- enter: 'docker-compose up -d' to build the image and start the service

# stopping the deployer

You need to stop the deployer using 'docker-compose down' from the odm-deployer project directory. 
If you change the code of the service, you need to remove the existing images by invoking the 
following Docker command:
docker rmi smartcontract/odm-deployer:1.0.0

To create a Docker image from the dockerfile in this directory use the following docker command:
docker build -t smartcontract/odm-deployer .
